# GarageBand Aid
This is a simple GarageBand aid that helps the visually impaired navigate the GarageBand application. The user can mute, play tracks, and change instruments in GarageBand without having to actually look at the application and navigate through it themselves. With a simple click of a button they can toggle these events.

This project is written using the V11 JavaScript library, which aims to tackle problems that the visually impaired face.
